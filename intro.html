	Welcome to my blog. My name is Logan. I will be trying to make a blog post everyday. A bit about myself: I enjoy playing video games, especially<br /> 
	League of Legends and Pokemon. Some of my other hobbies are watching Anime and programming. My favorite Anime to watch is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure <br /> 
	but I also enjoy Death Note and Hunter x Hunter. My favorite programming language is C# and you will often see my programs on this blog for download<br /> 
	to try out yourself.<br /> <br /> 
	Anyways I look forward to writing my first blog post tomorrow. :)
